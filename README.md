### My Process
- Design the Mobile viewport WHILE desinging the Desktop Viewport at the same time using
- Design the flex/grid system, making sure to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct
- Add in all the other HTML content
- Finished up all the CSS designs

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned
- CSS filter Property
- More Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow seems to be better approach
- More JavaScript
- In this scenario its better to look at the desktop design first than the mobile design and then plan acoordingly
